This CRAN Task View contains a list of packages useful for creating and interacting with Ecological Metadata. Note that this is not an official CRAN Task View, just one we have prepared for our own convenience, so it includes some packages only on GitHub and other non-CRAN resources we find useful. 
Contributions to this Task View are welcome, and encouraged. The source file for this particular task view file resides in a GitHub repository (see below), and pull requests are the preferred method for contributions. 


**Mapping Metadata**
[EML] (https://github.com/ropensci/EML) provides support for the serializing and parsing of all low-level EML concepts, but still assumes some familiarity with the EML standard, particularly for users seeking to create their own EML files. 

**Viewing Metadata**
[emldown] (https://github.com/ropenscilabs/emldown) emldown is a package for creating a human readable website based on EML metadata.

**Places to go for help**
