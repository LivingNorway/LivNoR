## Agenda

- Quick overview of this part of the Living Norway project – broad aims and vision 
- Package or packages? Should we aim for one super-package (or something along of lines of tidyverse a multiverse package) or 2, 3, or 4 stand-alone packages? 
- Identify and look at some of the other packages that we have found that do some of the functionality that Living Norway needs.
  * Do these packages warrant being dependencies or should we replicate the functions and adapt to our own uses (and then send pull requests to the original packages if warranted).
  * What criteria should we use to decide when each of these approaches (dependency or adaptation) are appropriate?
- Task list – agree on broad tasks. 
  * We can discuss these; in particular: the workshop ideas and some of the early stage conceptual developments.
- Agree on broad timeline and identify important milestones
- Any other comments

#editData::editData(LivingNorwayR)

## Look at some other packages

- Do these packages warrant being dependencies or should we replicate the functions and adapt to our own uses (and then send pull requests to the original packages if warranted).

- What criteria should we use to decide when each of these approaches (dependency or adaptation) are appropriate?
  
-**I propose we write a CRAN Task view for EML with the focus on achieving Living Norways aims**

## Task list

```{r, echo=FALSE}
collapsibleTree(
  LivingNorwayR,
  hierarchy = c("Major_task", "Task", "Task_title"),
  width = 800,
  zoomable = FALSE
)



```
